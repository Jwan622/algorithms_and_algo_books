# Preface

The techniques of algorithm design form one of the core practical technologies of computer science. Designing correct, efficient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires access to two distinct bodies of knowledge.

- __Techniques__ – Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental algorithm design techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming, depth-first search, backtracking, and heuristics. Perhaps the single most important design technique is modeling, the art of abstracting a messy real-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack.

- __Resources__ – Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants. Rather than laboring from scratch to produce a new algorithm for every task, they can figure out what is known about a particular problem. Rather than re-implementing popular algorithms from scratch, they seek existing implementations to serve as a starting point. They are familiar with many classic algorithmic problems, which provide sufficient source material to model most any application.

This is why reading about algorithms is important. You need to know the resources section... that is a knowledge game that you can win.

The book is divided into 3 parts:

1. _The Catalog of Algorithmic Problems_ – Since finding out what is known about an algorithmic problem can be a difficult task, I provide a catalog of the 75 most important problems arising in practice. By browsing through this catalog, the student or practitioner can quickly identify what their problem is
called, what is known about it, and how they should proceed to solve it. To aid in problem identification, we include a pair of “before” and “after” pictures for each problem, illustrating the required input and output specifications. One perceptive reviewer called my book “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Algorithms” on the strength of this catalog.The catalog is the most important part of this book.

2. _War Stories_ - War Stories – In practice, algorithm problems do not arise at the beginning of a large project. Rather, they typically arise as subproblems when it becomes clear that the programmer does not know how to proceed or that the current solution is inadequate. To provide a better perspective on how algorithm problems arise in the real world, we include a collection of “war stories,” or tales from our experience with real problems. The moral of these stories is that algorithm design and
analysis is not just theory, but an important tool to be pulled out and used as needed.

3. _Electronic Component_ – Since the practical person is usually looking for a program more than an algorithm, we provide pointers to solid implementations whenever they are available. We have collected these implementations at one central [website site](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/∼algorith)

Equally important is what we do not do in this book. We do not stress the mathematical analysis of algorithms, leaving most of the analysis as informal arguments.
